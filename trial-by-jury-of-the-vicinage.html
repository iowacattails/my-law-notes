[…] <br><br>Under this extensive provision, they may proceed in a manner extremely dangerous to liberty<br><br>—persons accused may be carried from one extremity of the State to another, and be tried, not by an impartial jury of the vicinage, acquainted with his character and the circumstances of the fact, <br><br>but by a jury unacquainted with both, and who may be biased against him.<br><br> Is not this sufficient to alarm men?<br><br> How different is this from the immemorial practice of your British ancestors, and your own? <br><br>I need not tell you that by the common law a number of hundredors were required on a jury, and that afterwards it was sufficient if the jurors came from the same county. <br><br>With less than this the people of England have never been satisfied. <br><br>That paper ought to have declared that the common law was in force.”<br><br><br><br>Context: Henry is objecting to Article III, Section 2 (“trial … shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed”) because it does not explicitly require the jury to be from the local neighborhood<br><br>.<br><br>“A constitution, sir, ought to be like a beacon, held up to the public eye, so as to be understood by every man. […] <br><br>Some gentlemen have observed that the word jury implies or necessarily means a jury of the vicinage. <br><br>There are so many inconsistencies in this that, for my part, I cannot understand it. By the bill of rights in England, a subject has a right to a trial by his peers. <br><br>What is meant by his peers? Those who reside near him, his neighbors, and who are well acquainted with his character and situation in life. […] <br><br>Is not this the sense in which it has always been used, both in the old countries and in this? […]<br><br>Will the honorable gentleman tell us that the word jury alone, without any addition, secures the trial by jury of the vicinage?” <br><br><br><br>Context: Henry ridicules the Federalist argument that everyone already knows “jury” means a local jury, insisting the Constitution must spell it out plainly.<br><br>.<br><br>“Mr. HENRY. Mr. Chairman, […] will the honorable gentleman tell me that the trial by jury of the vicinage—where the party resides—is secured in this new plan as fully as it was in our old Bill of Rights? <br><br>True, sir, there is to be a trial by jury in the State where the fact was committed. But, sir, this State, for instance, is so large that your jury may be collected five hundred miles from where the party resides<br><br>—no neighbors of his to know his character, or to judge of the circumstances of the fact by a view of them, but strangers, who may be ignorant of both. […] <br><br>The principle of an impartial jury drawn from the vicinage, acquainted with the character of the party and the circumstances of the fact, is of the utmost importance. […]<br><br>It is a principle of safety to the people, and has been the cause of jealousy in all free countries.” <br><br><br><br>Context: Henry contrasts the explicit vicinage protection in Virginia’s 1776 Declaration of Rights (§8) with the vague federal language, warning that an accused man could be dragged hundreds of miles away to be judged by strangers.<br><br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="blob:https://iowacattails.github.io/830b8bef-2d44-422a-a9f8-23de2fc2e0b5" style="max-width:50%;"></div><br><em>Tags: none</em><br><a href="index.html" class="back">← Return to Law Book Links</a></body></html>
