<h1>Discovery</h1>
<p><br><br><strong>Discovery is (Roman) Civil Law Process, not Common Law</strong><br>.<br><br>HAVING already suficiently considered how and why the common-law system of pleading differs from that of the civil and canon law, it remains to inquire how the peculiarities of the former affect the subject of discovery. <br><br>The inquiry is embarrassed by what may be termed the modern degeneracy of the common-law system.  <br><br>If the question could be limited to the period of time when that system was still in its full vigor, the answer would be easy. <br><br>First, it would be clear that neither party would be entitled to any discovery until the pleadings were finished, for until then it could not be known what discovery would be needed, nor even whether any would be needed. <br><br>Secondly, the question what discovery would be needed, and what, therefore, the parties respectively would be entitled to, would depend, not upon the allegations made in the respective pleadings, or any of them, but upon the question on which the parties were at issue, and therefore the amount needed would be small in comparison with the amount needed in the civil and canon law. <br><br>Thirdly, discovery would not be needed for the purpose of eliminating the uncontroverted facts, as that would be sufficiently done by the pleadings. <br><br>Fourthly, as the question (continued)<br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="blob:https://iowacattails.github.io/66b6b767-4bb9-4af1-904d-183de6d777cc"></div><br>to be tried would be as to the truth of a matter alleged by one of the parties, and indispensable to his case or defence, and upon a denial of which the other party was willing to rest the entire case, it would seldom be worth the while of either of the parties to attempt to prove by discovery anything which he could prove by witnesses-<br><br>What then was the effect of the relaxation which the system gradually underwent? <br><br>Perhaps that question can best be answered by first asking what would have been the effect upon discovery of a complete abrogation of the rule against pleading double;<br><br> for the answer to that question is easy. <br><br>There would then be no compulsion upon cither party to admit (by not denying) the truth of anything alleged by his adversary; and, as litigants do not as a rule (any more than military commanders) do anything voluntarily to help their adversaries, <br><br>it must be assumed that, in the case supposed, everything alleged by either of the parties would be denied by the other. <br><br>Therefore, as regards the amount of proof which would be required from the parties respectively (and therefore as regards discovery), the abrogation of the rule against pleading double would be the abrogation of everything peculiar to the common-law system, and the parties would be left in the same position as in the civil and canon law, i. e., each of them would have to prove everything alleged by him. <br><br>What then would be the effect upon discovery of any partial abrogation of the rule against pleading double? <br><br>It would depend upon the degree in which the partial abrogation left each party free to deny everything alleged by his adversary.<br><br> It should be observed, however, that neither a partial nor a total abrogation of the rule would enable any one to say with certainty, in any given case, how much or what discovery would be needed, until the pleadings were finished; <br><br>for no one could say with certainty that each of the parties would deny everything that he was free to deny, nor whether or to what extent any restraint which might still remain would be sufficient to prevent a denial.<br><br>Would the partial or total abrogation of the rule against pleading double affect the time at which the parties respectively would be entitled to discovery? <br><br>It would still be true that each material and issuable allegation would be constructively admitted, unless it was separately traversed, and that upon each traverse an issue would arise.<br><br>If, therefore, a defendant pleaded both affirmatively and negatively to the plaintiff's declaration, while the pleadings would continue in respect to the affirmative plea, they would cease..]<br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="blob:https://iowacattails.github.io/a53c2f09-14fb-437b-908a-cb98410e265b"></div><br><br><em>Citation: HARVARD  LAW REVIEW.
