As men may unite themselves to a civil society by tacit agreement, so likewise, when they are so united, they may by tacit agreement settle a form of government.<br><br><img src="images/IMG_9007.jpeg"></div><hr><p style="text-align:center"><a href="index.html">All Law Notes</a></p></div></body></html>
