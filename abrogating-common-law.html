<p>The attempt to abrogate the ancient common law of England in America began almost immediately after the Revolution was won.</p>

<p>While the Founders repeatedly declared in their writings and in the Declaration of Independence itself that they were fighting to preserve “the rights of Englishmen” and “the ancient constitution,” a quiet counter-movement began within a single generation to redefine, restrict, and ultimately replace that very common law with something new—something that could be more easily controlled by legislatures, judges, and eventually administrative agencies.</p>

<h2>The Innovation Called “American Common Law”</h2>

<p>The phrase “American common law” is itself a modern invention designed to disparage and dilute the specific, ancient, and highly libertarian content of the true common law of England as it existed in 1776.</p>

<p>By calling it “American” common law, the legal profession was able to pretend that the ancient maxims, the grand jury indictment requirement, the unanimous jury verdict, the prohibition on bills of attainder, the absolute prohibition on ex post facto laws, the right to trial by jury in all criminal and most civil cases, the prohibition on excessive bail and cruel punishments, and dozens of other concrete protections were somehow optional, evolving, or subject to “balancing” against state interests.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<h2>The Common Law Received in 1776 Was Fixed Forever</h2>

<p>The Declaration of Independence and every state constitution adopted between 1776 and 1787 declared that the common law of England—as it stood at the time of independence—was received as the birthright of the people and the foundation of their new governments.</p>

<p>That common law was not a vague set of principles. It was a specific body of law built over seven centuries of struggle against royal power, memorialized in Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628), the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), the Bill of Rights (1689), and hundreds of landmark cases from Bonham’s Case (1610) to Entick v Carrington (1765).</p>

<p>It included concrete, non-negotiable rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No man may be deprived of life, liberty, or property but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.</li>
  <li>No ex post facto laws.</li>
  <li>No bills of attainder.</li>
  <li>Grand jury indictment required for infamous crimes.</li>
  <li>Unanimous jury verdict required for conviction.</li>
  <li>No excessive bail, no cruel and unusual punishments.</li>
  <li>The home is sacred against general warrants.</li>
  <li>Trial by jury preserved in all cases where it existed at common law.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were not aspirational. They were the supreme law.</p>

<h2>How the Abrogation Was Accomplished</h2>

<p>The abrogation happened slowly and deliberately:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Courts began citing each other instead of Coke, Hale, and Blackstone.</li>
  <li>State legislatures began passing “codes” that quietly overruled common-law protections.</li>
  <li>The federal government created administrative agencies with the power to act as prosecutor, judge, and jury.</li>
  <li>Judges invented “substantive due process” and “balancing tests” to water down absolute prohibitions.</li>
  <li>The grand jury was reduced to a rubber stamp.</li>
  <li>Civil asset forfeiture revived the hated general warrant under a new name.</li>
  <li>“Plea bargaining” replaced trial by jury in 97% of cases.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Constitution Forbids This</h2>

<p>Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause) and the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments make it impossible to legally abrogate the common law of England as received in 1776.</p>

<p>The Northwest Ordinance (1787), re-enacted by the First Congress in 1789, declared:</p>

<blockquote>“Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians… and in the just preservation of rights and property… no man shall be deprived of his liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land…”</blockquote>

<p>That phrase — “the law of the land” — was universally understood in 1789 to mean the common law of England.</p>

<h2>Conclusion & Remedy</h2>

<p>Therefore, every statute, code, or judicial opinion that redefines, limits, or abrogates the ancient common law of England as it stood in 1776 is null and void ab initio, being repugnant to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The only remedy is restoration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Return to the grand jury as the shield of the people.</li>
  <li>Restore unanimous jury verdicts.</li>
  <li>Abolish civil asset forfeiture.</li>
  <li>End plea bargaining in serious cases.</li>
  <li>Repeal all administrative “courts.”</li>
  <li>Declare all statutes in derogation of the common law void.</li>
</ul>

<p>The common law of England is not dead.</p>

<p>It is waiting to be remembered.</p>
