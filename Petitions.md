> — Declaration of Independence, 1776

### U.S. Constitution
**Article IV, Section 4**  
The United States shall guarantee to every State… a Republican Form of Government… and on Application of the Legislature, **or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened)** against domestic Violence.

**First Amendment**  
Congress shall make no law… abridging… the right of the people… to **petition the Government for a redress of grievances**.

### Idaho Constitution – Article I, Section 10
The people shall have the right… to **petition the legislature for redress of grievances**.

### Historical Foundation
The Right to Petition is a **common-law fundamental right** secured by:
- **Magna Carta**, Chapter 61 (1215)
- **English Bill of Rights** (1689): “That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal.”

### Cushing’s Lex Parliamentaria Americana (1874)
> “It is with respect to measures of a public character, that the right of petition has been deemed the most sacred…”
