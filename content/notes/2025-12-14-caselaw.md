“All laws that are repugnant to the Constitution are Null & Void. Marbury vs. Madison.”

Why  repugn  case-law and then cite the same case-law \[Marbury v Madison\] as your authority.

Why not simple state principles of the fundamental law that may/may not be accurately portrayed in the Marbury v Madison BAR lawyer word-salad?

Algernon Sidney (1623–1683) repeatedly and forcefully asserted in his Discourses Concerning Government (published 1698) that laws contrary to the fundamental constitution are null and void by their very nature.

     1. “No law can be made by any power that is above the law; and all laws that are repugnant to the constitution are void in themselves.”— Discourses, Chapter 2, § 23

2\. “That which is not just is not law; and that which is not law ought not to be obeyed. … Laws repugnant to the original constitution are void.”— Discourses, Chapter 3, § 36

3\. “Magistrates have no power but what is given by the fundamental laws; and if they act contrary to those laws, their acts are null, and to be reputed as nothing.”— Discourses, Chapter 3, § 16

4\. “If the laws of God and man are therefore of no effect when the magistracy is left at liberty to break them, and if the lusts of those who are too strong for the tribunals of justice cannot be otherwise restrained than by sedition, tumults and war, those seditions, tumults and wars are justified by the laws of God and man. … The laws that enjoin obedience to kings are void, when kings cease to do right.”— Discourses, Chapter 3, § 44 (the most famous passage, often quoted by American Founders
