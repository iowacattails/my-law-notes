<h1>jury-of-vicinage</h1>

<p>Jury of the vicinage ( neighborhood)<br><br>Pg. 412-413<br><br>[…Under this extensive provision, they may proceed in a manner extremely dangerous to liberty—persons accused may be carried from one extremity of the state to another, and be tried, not by an impartial jury of the vicinage, acquainted with his character and the circumstances of the fact, but by a jury unacquainted with both, and who may be biased against him. Is not this sufficient to alarm men? How different is this from the immemorial practice of your British ancestors, and your own? I need not tell you that by the common law a number of hundredors were required on a jury, and that afterwards it was sufficient if the jurors came from the same county. With less than this, the people of England have never been satisfied. That paper ought to have declared the common law in force.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Pg. 412-413<br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mr. Henry: Mr. Chairman, I have the highest opinion of the gentleman’s candor, sir, as I informed you before, and I am happy to find he has so far explained what he meant. But, sir, has he mended the matter? Is not the ancient trial by jury preserved in the Virginia Bill of Rights? And is that the case in the new plan? No, sir, they can do it if they please. Will the gentleman tell me if the trial by a jury of the vicinage—where the party resides—is preserved?<br><br>True, sir, there is to be a trial by jury in the state where the fact was committed. But, sir, this state, for instance, is so large that your juries may be collected 500 miles from where the party resides—no neighbors who are acquainted with their characters, their good or bad conduct in life, to judge of the unfortunate man who may be thus exposed to the rigor of that government. Compare this security, then, sir, in our Bill of Rights to that in the new plan of government. In the first, you have it; in the other, in my opinion, not at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>HENRY. VIRGINIA.<br><br><br><br>Page 413<br><br><br><br>The principle of an impartial jury, drawn from the vicinage, acquainted with the character of the defendant and the circumstances of the case, is of utmost importance. A jury composed of strangers, unacquainted with the accused, may harbor prejudice against him, a matter which ought to raise great alarm among the people. This practice stands in contrast to the immemorial customs of our British ancestors, whose experience I myself have witnessed. Under the common law, it was once required that a jury be summoned from a certain number of hundreds; later, this was simplified to jurors from the same county. The people of England were never satisfied with less than this, and it ought to have been declared that the common law remains in force.<br><br><br><br>Further, there is a danger in the powers granted to Congress. Members of that body might, in time, loosen the restrictions against imposing excessive fines, demanding excessive bail, or inflicting cruel and unusual punishments—practices expressly prohibited by the declaration of rights. What has distinguished the ancestors of this nation? They would not admit the use of torture, nor cruel and barbarous punishment. Yet, there lies a risk that Congress may introduce the practices of civil law, in preference to that of the common law, adopting the methods of France, Spain, and Germany, including the infliction of torture.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>https://archive.org/details/debatesofseveral03unse<br><br><br><br>https://iowacattails.github.io/My-notes/jury-of-the-vicinage.html?v=2025-11-27T17:00:00Z</p>
