# abrogating common law

How can common law be abrogated if you can’t define common law?
What is common law?

 Define common law.
Define the common law of England.
Define American common law.


[cite this book]

[…”the law/equity divide, from the rise of the Court of Chancery in the 14th century to the merger of law and equity under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.…]

This merger of Law/Equity Is the heart of the 19th century innovative phrase “American Common Law” It is FAR from being a merger.. It is a Romanist take-over our fundamental law.

	Romanist: used to describe scholars or jurists who advocate for the  Roman Civil law, the Corpus Juris Civilis… in contradistinction to common law.

It’s really all about the meanings and signification of words and phrases of the English language. 

TITLE 9 
EVIDENCE
CHAPTER 1 
JUDICIAL KNOWLEDGE
9-101.  FACTS JUDICIALLY NOTICED. Courts take judicial notice of the following facts:
1.  The true signification of all English words and phrases, and of legal expressions
8.  The laws of nature

The  description of the book 

The merger of [common] Law and Equity [ Roman Civil Law ]… 

All the Romanists use this phrase, 
Bentham, Mill, Livingston, Dudley, etc.
1. Law vs. Equity - The divide
2. The rise and rejection of the Court of Chancery started in 12th century.. not 14th 
3. Rules of Civil Procedure is the destruction of common law, NOT a merger.
[…the law/equity divide..]

Equity has 6 definitions according to Webster. The Equity here in the “Law/Equity divide”  is  definition #4

4. In jurisprudence, the correction or qualification of law, when too severe or defective; ..][..
Hence a court of equity or chancery, is a court which corrects the operation of the literal text of the law, and supplies its defects..]

What are the “defects” allowed by Chancery? 

Book page 32
[…Lord Coke has, in his summary manner, stated, that three things were to be judged of in the court of conscience or equity : covin, accident, and breach of confidence..]

Abuses of the Law
[…7.  The excess of jurisdiction in Chancery, in examining judgments at common law, and examining suits pending at common law. That Court ought to do NOTHING else but compel the execution of trusts, and moderate the rigour of forfeitures..]

Bouvier's Common Law Dictionary
( Pg. 162)“Law” or "At Law" ["...This phrase is used to point out that a thing is to be done according to the course of the common law; it is distinguished from a proceeding in equity..."]

writ of habeas corpus
(In England) [..."It was not until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that the writ of habeas corpus came into prominence. This occurred because the common law courts, in their struggle for power over the rival central courts the Chancery the Star Chamber, the High Commission, and the Admiralty used it for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction over cases handled by the other courts and thus increasing their own importance."]

The Earliest abuse of Chancery  of Common Law courts in America I can find


THE principle that the “7th amendment” was founded on, in America, 100 years before, PROVING The Roman Civil Law Chancellors were trying to abrogate common law beyond the 3  instances allowed .
 Maryland’s 1690s grievance against chancery overreach— (Pg. 18)
Putt to the Vote whether the motion on Saturday made concerning the Chancellor granting an Injunction after a Verdict of Twelve men & Judgms given thereon, be a Grievance or noe, and Carryed Nemine contradicente in the Affirmatiue..] “a Grievance… in Derogation of the Common Law” —The decision was unanimously agreed upon (“nemine contradicente”) in the affirmative—everyone agreed it is a grievance. In simpler terms: It was unanimously decided that a Chancellor overriding a jury’s verdict and judgment by issuing an injunction is indeed problematic.. and this the basis of Article VII (“7th amendment “)

The “Seventh amendment”  “suits at common law” Bouvier’s common law dictionary 1856 notes: “The phrase ‘common law’ occurs in the seventh ARTICLE of the amendments…‘In suits at common law… the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. ’ The ‘common law’ here mentioned IS THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND, and NOT of any particular state” …]

§25 
3. But equity has a more restrained and qualified meaning. The remedies for the redress of wrongs, and for the enforcement of rights, are distinguished into two classes, 
first, those which are administered in courts of common law; 
and, secondly, those which are administered in courts of equity. 
Rights which are recognized and protected, and wrongs which are redressed by the former courts, are called legal rights and legal injuries. 
Rights which are recognized and protected, and wrongs which are redressed by the latter courts only, are called equitable rights and equitable injuries.
The former are said to be rights and wrongs at common law, and the remedies, therefore, are remedies at common law; 
the latter are said to be rights and wrongs in equity, and the remedies, therefore, are remedies in equity. 
Equity jurisprudence
may, therefore, properly be said to be that portion of remedial justice which is exclusively administered by a court of equity, 
as contradistinguished from that remedial justice, which is exclusively administered
by a court of law. 
Joseph Story-Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence, as Administered in England and America. Vol. 1, 1st ed., 1836

7. The excess of jurisdiction in Chancery, in examining judgments at common law, and examining suits pending at common law. That Court ought to do nothing else but compel the execution of trusts, and moderate the rigour of forfeitures: the common law ought to try fraud.

The Federal Rules of CIVIL Procedure are not common law-
Rules Enabling Act of 1934 .. The gateway to the FRCP

1. Charles E. Clark [ under Franklin Delano’s Roosevelts administration] A prominent legal scholar, federal judge, and Dean of Yale Law School, Clark was the Reporter of the Advisory Committee. He was instrumental in drafting the rules and shaping their content. Clark’s vision for a simplified, flexible system of "notice pleading" (AS  OPPOSED TO “RIGID COMMON-LAW PLEADING) became a cornerstone of the FRCP. His academic influence and practical insights were vital to the rules’ design.

Judiciary Act of 1789.
of William Maclay
Pg. 95-96
that the advantages of chancery were to my certain knowledge . overstated ..]
[…Up rose George Read in angry mood. Said he had a cause of that kind in Pennsylvania ; that he had consulted the ablest men there and received for answer [that] there was no remedy in Pennsylvania, and asserted that the people of Pennsylvania wished for chancery, and many of them lamented the want of it…]
[…I got up ; declared, as far as I knew the sentiments of the people of Pennsylvania, they disliked a chancery, but that many of them knew not even the name. I never heard any people speak in favor of it, but some gentlemen of the bar, and even among them some doubted whether it would do most harm or good ; that in the general it was considered by those who knew anything of the matter, AS THE FIELD WHERE THE GENTLEMEN OF THE BAR WOULD REAP THE FULLEST HARVEST, and it was considered that they enjoyed a plentiful crop as matters stood now.


1) Courts of Chancery date Father back than 14th century

The constitution of England, or an account of the english government-1777, De Lolme.  (Pg. 104). [..It happened, therefore, by a somewhat singular conjunction of circumstances, that to the Roman laws brought over to England by Monks, the idea of Ecclesiastical power became associated, in the same manner as the idea of Despotism was afterwards associated with the Religion of the same Monks, when favoured by Kings who endeavoured to establish a despotic government.     The Nobility, at all times, rejected these laws, even with a degree of ill humour; (a) and the usurper Stephen, (Pg. 105) ...whose interest it was to conciliate their affections, went so far as to prohibit the study of them.    The general disposition of things establishing, as we have seen, a great communication between the Nobility and the People, the aversion to the Roman laws gradually spread itself far and wide..][..Roger Vacarius (1120-1200?) was an Italian authority in civil and canon law who was known to author the Liber pauperum which between the years 1190-1220 influenced the development of legal studies in the University of Oxford. According to Gervase of Canterbury, Vacarius became the first known teacher of Roman law in England.    
A Manual of the Roman Civil Law Arranged After the Analysis of Dr. Hallifax-1859, George Leapingwell,     (Pg. 18) [..With regard to the Civil law in England, it was first introduced by Theobald, a Norman archbishop of Canterbury, who placed Roger Vacarius, a Lombard, at Oxford, to teach it.  The English lawyers of that period were much opposed to the Civil law, so they contended that it was hostile to the liberties of England..] [..The Norman nobility were hostile to it; and King Stephen, who was completely in the power of his barons, issued an order against the study of it, and altogether prohibited it..]
A new abridgment of the law-1730, Matthew Bacon Bacon. (book page 102)Each of the universities had several powers and privileges by charters from the kings of this realm, particularly one in the eighth of Hen. 4, whereby they were authorized to hold plea of all causes arising within the university according to the course of the civil law: but in the opinion of all the judges of England the grant was held not to be good; for that the king could not by his grant alter the law of the land..] [..By letters patent (not confirmed by parliament) dated thirtieth March, 11 Car. 1, granted to the University of Oxford, their old privileges are explained, and larger granted. 1 Mod. 161, Magdalen College case; Wood's Inst. 518..] [..Their courts are called the Chancellors' Courts. The chancellors are usually peers of the realm, and  appointed over the whole university. But their courts are kept by their vice-chancellors, their assistants, or deputies: the causes are managed by advocates or proctors..][..These courts have jurisdiction in all causes ecclesiastical and civil (except mayhem, felony, and freehold,) where a scholar, servant, or minister of the university https://archive.org/details/ 

is one of the parties in suit.


  The history and analysis of the common law of England.  1713.  (Pg. 34) […The Chancellor of Oxford proceeded according to the Rule of the Civil Law in a Case of Debt, the Judgment was reversed in King’s Bench, wherein the Principal Error assigned was, because they proceeded per Legem Civilem ubi quilibet ligen Domini Regis Regni sui Angliae in quibuscunque placitis o querelis infra hoc Regnum facia o emergentibus de jure tractari debet per Communem Legem Angliae; 
[…whatever pleas or complaints arise within this Kingdom, must be treated by the Common Law of England..]

You have cited the Confirmation Cartarum before on the call.. which means Confirmation of the Charters as the common law/law of the land. In the same call you also admitted Trumps acknowledged we are returning to 1776… what exactly do you think that means?

JUDGE DRAYTON'S CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY OF CHARLESTOWN, SOUTH-CAROLINA.
TUESDAY, the 23d day of APRIL, 1776..]

(alluded to in the Declaration of Independence…	“For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies.”)

[..By establishing in Quebeck the Roman Catholick Religion, and an arbitrary Government [Roman Civil Law] ; instead of the Protestant Religion and a free Government.

Confirmation of the Charters (Confirmatio Cartarum)
(digital page 163-164)
[….”This is a clause worthy to be written in letters of gold: that our judges, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers, who under us have the laws of our land to guide them, shall allow the said charters in all their points, which in any plea shall come before them in judgment. And here it is to be observed that the laws are the judges’ guides or leaders, according to that old rule: Lex est exercitus judicum tutissimus dux (The law is the safest leader of the army of judges), or lex est optimus judicis pedagogus (The law is the best guide of the judge), and lex est tutissima cassis (The law is the safest helmet).
There is an old legal word, called guidagium, which signifies an office of guiding travelers through dangerous and unknown ways. Here it appears that the laws of the realm have this office to guide the judges in all causes that come before them in the ways of right justice, which never yet misguided any man who certainly knew them and truly followed them.
The great charter, as common law, and the charter of the forest, in amendment of our realm: The sense hereof is that the Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest are to be held as the common law, that is, the law common to all; and that both charters are in amendment of the realm, that is, to amend great mischiefs and inconveniences which oppressed the whole realm before the making of them.

The Common Law of England, as articulated by Sir John Fortescue (De Laudibus Legum Anglie, c. 1470), John Rastell (Exposiciones Terminorum Legum Anglorum, c. 1523), Christopher St. Germain (Doctor and Student, 1528), and Joseph Story (Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833), is grounded in custom, reason, and natural law, embodying universal principles of justice. Fortescue praised its liberty-protecting mechanisms, like trial by jury. Rastell defined Common Law as “that law which is grounded upon the general custom of the realm, and upon the law of nature, which is called the law of reason.” St. Germain tied Common Law to natural law, the law of God, and the people’s reasoned consent, stating, “The law of God and the law of man [common law] be so joined together that it is hard to discern where the one endeth and the other beginneth.” 

Joseph Story, referencing the Declaration of Rights and Grievances (1774), linked the Seventh Amendment to the Common Law as it existed in 1774, affirming our Rights to “the common law of England.” 

Noah Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) defines “common law” as unwritten law from immemorial usage and popular consent.

Hold onto your pants I’m about to cite Vattel… I know you don’t like based on your opinion stated on the call once because he’s French
[ but he’s actually Swiss - Patrick Henry [ I know you like to drop the phrase “ Founding Fathers.. not sure if you’d include Patrick though] argued the Parsons 2 penny case- 1758  Cited Vattel 22 times along with Grotius, who was Dutch 3 times]

Emer de Vattel’s The Law of Nations (1758) 

The Common Law, as fundamental law, limits legislative power; statutes and Acts contradicting due process of common law may not be “the law of the land,” see  opinion of Daniel Webster in the Dartmouth case. 

Terms like “American Common Law” lack historical basis, and is merely “the common law of England” altered by judge-made law/“ stare decesis”  and legislative alterations of the fundamental law.  

LAW OF NATIONS
LEGISLATURE 
FUNDAMENTAL LAW
Emer de Vattel- limits on legislature 
Book 1 , Chpt.3,  §34
“This is called the legislative power. The nation may intrust the exercise of it to the prince, or to an assembly ; or to that assembly and the prince jointly; who have then a right to make new laws and to repeal old ones. It is asked whether their power extends to the fundamental laws, whether they may change the constitution of the state? The principles we lave laid down lead us to decide with certainty, that the authority of these legislators DOES NOT EXTEND SO FAR, and that they ought to consider the fundamental laws as SACRED, if the nation has not, in very espress terms, given them power to change them. For the constitution of the state ought to possess stability : and since that was first established by the nation, which aferwards intrusted certain persons with the legislative power, the fundamental laws are excepted from their commission. It is visible that the society only intended to make provision for having the state constantiy furnished with laws suited to PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURES, and, for that purpose, gave the legislature the power of abrogating the ancient civil and political laws that were NOT FUNDAMENTAL…]

If you can’t stomach Vattel…
American Jurisprudence 16 2d § 100 / August 2017 Update
A constitution is usually a declaration of PRINCIPLES of the
FUNDAMENTAL LAW, many of its provisions being only commands to the legislature to enact laws to carry out the purposes of the framers of the constitution or mere RESTRICTIONS upon the POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE to pass laws.

The Romanist Codifiers  call it “concurrent jurisdiction “

CONCURRENT, adjective
1. Meeting; uniting; accompanying; acting in conjunction; agreeing in the same act; contributing to the same event or effect; operating with.

3. Joint and equal; existing together and operating on the same objects. The courts of the United States, and those of the States have, in some cases, concurrent jurisdiction..]

But we know they are not equal…

The common law stood in stark contradistinction to equity, admiralty, maritime, and Roman civil law. 
George Leapingwell’s Manual of the Roman Civil Law (Pg. 19) notes that  “the Civil Law is used in Admiralty and ecclesiastical courts” , yet asserts: “in all these THE COMMON LAW has reserved to itself a paramount authority”..]

JURISDIC'TION, noun [Latin jurisdictio; jus, juris, law, and dictio, from dico, to pronounce.] has 4 definitions according to Webster.
Juris = body of fundamental law
Diction= pronounce 

4. The limit within which power may be exercised.
Jurisdiction, in its most general sense, is the power to make, declare or apply the law

Which body of Law are you declaring when you say “ American Common Law”??

The Codifier, Livingston in 1805 with his innovative Code of Procedure for Louisiana didn’t hide his intent of abrogating common law over the Roman Civil Law exercised before succession. But to become a part of the Union you must adopt the body of law of the Republic.. not craft your own Process/Procedure.

Pg. 2960
[…The Ancient Maxim….Non ex regula ius sumatur, sed ex iure quod est, regula fiat," ..]
translates to:
“The law is not drawn from the rule, but the rule is made from the law that exists."
   The common law of England and Magna Charta is the “Rule of Law”.
