# Abrogating Common Law

## Introduction: The Confirmation of the Charters (Magna Carta Confirmation)
The Confirmation of the Charters (1297, Edward I) is a key document in English common law history. On pages 163-164, it includes this golden clause (worthy to be written in letters of gold):

> "This is a clause worthy to be written in letters of gold: that our judges, sheriffs, mayors, and other land ministers, who under us have to have the laws of our charts in all their points, which in any plea shall come before them in judgment. And here it is to be observed that the laws are the oldest guides; lex or leader's according to the tutissimus dux (The law is the safest leader of the army of judges); or lex est optimum judicis (The law is the best guide of the judge); and safest lex est tutissima cassis (the law is the safest helmet). There is an old legal word, called guidagium, which signifies an office of guiding travelers..."

This emphasizes that **all pleas and complaints arising within the Kingdom must be treated by the Common Law of England**. It means the common law is the supreme guide for judges—abrogating (overriding) it undermines the entire system.

## Historical Context: Judge Drayton's Charge to the Grand Jury (April 23, 1776)
In the lead-up to American independence, **Judge William Henry Drayton** delivered this charge to the Grand Jury of Charlestown, South-Carolina, on **Tuesday, the 23rd day of April, 1776**. It alludes to the Declaration of Independence and warns against abrogating English common law in favor of arbitrary systems (like the Quebec Act, which imposed Roman Catholic civil law).

> "For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies."

Drayton argues that the British were abrogating common law protections, justifying revolution. This charge was ordered published by the Grand Jury as a call to preserve common law principles.

- **Key excerpt on abrogation**: The Quebec Act (1774) established Roman Catholic civil law and an arbitrary Protestant government, abrogating English common law in Quebec. Drayton sees this as a threat to all colonies, violating the "free system of English laws."
- **Connection to independence**: "Oppressed by such a variety of enormous injuries... the Representatives of South-Carolina... found themselves under an unavoidable necessity of establishing a form of Government."

## Implications: What Does Abrogating Common Law Mean Today?
Abrogating common law means overriding judge-made precedents with statutes or executive actions, eroding the "safest helmet" (tutissima cassis) of justice. As Drayton implied, it leads to arbitrary rule—seen in modern cases where common law rights (e.g., due process, jury trials) are eroded.

- **Historical abrogation examples**:
  - Quebec Act (1774): Replaced common law with French civil law.
  - Stamp Act (1765): Taxed legal documents, interfering with common law courts.

- **Modern relevance**: The Confirmation's clause requires judges to follow common law above all. Abrogating it risks "guiding travelers" (judges) off the path, as per the old legal term *guidagium*.
