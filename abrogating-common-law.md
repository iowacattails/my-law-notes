# abrogating common law

The courts have been slowly abrogating the common law for decades...

“The common law is the absolute perfection of reason...” — Sir William Blackstone

### Judge Drayton’s Charge to the Grand Jury  
Charlestown, South-Carolina — Tuesday, the 23rd day of April, 1776

> "For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies."

This charge was ordered to be published by the Grand Jury and directly references the abrogation of English common law.

### Confirmation of the Charters (1297)
The famous clause worthy to be written in letters of gold:

> "...that our justices, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers which under us have the laws of our land to guide, shall allow the said charters pleaded before them in judgement in all their points..."

This makes the Common Law of England the supreme law over any statute that attempts to override it.
