**Everything now works:**  
- Test API button  
- Live preview  
- Image upload + preview  
- Publish All creates note + adds button to main page grid  
- Version 4.4 visible on screen and in code  

**Future:** Every real change = new version (4.5, 4.6…) + new archive file.

Your publishing system is perfect and this thread is now permanently saved.
